# The Venusian

"The Venusian" is a hybrid of Victron Energy's "venus" operating system for the
Raspberry Pi (and some others), and Debian GNU/Linux.

The Venusian allows you to run a Victron system on any Debian-based system.
This includes your Intel laptop.

This is of course impossible — but we're doing it anyway.

## Rationale

You might already have a Debian-based server in the same room as your Victron
installation, and yet another computer that nibbles away at your battery
isn't what you signed up for.

You might want to run code on your Victron system that won't work with
Python 8, or some other software that's not packaged for Victron's
OpenEmbedded installation. (NB, Python 8 is end-of-life in mid-2024.)

You might need a kernel module that the Victron kernel doesn't support.

You might want to re-use the backup solution you already have, instead of
coding some custom solution for Venus.

You might be interested in plugging a USB stick into your Venus
installation for RAID-0.

You might want to stop using the antiquated daemontools' supervisor and
runtime system because they don't talk to dbus or anything,
indiscriminately restart things which are broken or you don't need, and/or
don't send their logs anywhere.

… or maybe you just don't particularly like OpenEmbedded.


## Usage

* Install (see below).
* `systemctl start user@venus`
* The Venus GUI is available on VNC port 5901.

For external network access, you either need an `iptables` rule is required.

### Change the VNC port

If port 1 is in use:

* `echo SCREEN=3 >>/etc/venusian/venus/vars`
* `systemctl restart user@venus`

## Background

Venus binaries run on the host system, using QEMU if necessary.

The Venus subsystem uses a session DBUS, not the system's.

Its programs run as the user "venus", not root.

The Venus system does *not* run inside a chroot environment or a container.

### OpenEmbedded libraries

Venus (yes, even on Raspberry Pi 4) is an `armhf` system; its binaries thus
use `/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3` as their ELF loader.

The Venusian assumes that its host is not an `armhf` system
and doesn't need to run any other `armhf` binaries.

The Venusian hijacks this `armhf` loader by patching the `/lib` and
`/usr/lib` strings that define its library search path, to `/v/l/` and
`/v/u/lib` respectively. Appropriate symlinks then ensure that the Venus
binaries use Venus libraries.

This means that your root directory will gain `/v` and `/data` entries.
Sorry about that; ways around this problem are being investigated.

We also need to add two symlinks to `/usr/lib` (`gconv` and `fonts`)
to convince `vedirect` and `gui` to not crash. These directories should not
exist on modern Debian systems, so there's no problem.


#### Alternate solution

If you do need to run non-Venus `armhf` binaries, we could alternately
modify the Venus binaries so their loader is in `/v/l/` instead of `/lib/`.

Patches welcome.


### Venusian user

The Venusian system runs as the user `venus`. It's controlled by a
user-level systemd instance and uses that user's session dbus instead of
the system's.

Thus, a simple `systemctl restart user@venus` restarts the whole Venus
subsystem cleanly, without requiring a possibly-risky reboot that takes an
order of magnitude longer and is much more disruptive.


### Devices ("udev")

Venus handles new serial devices by creating a symlink in /etc/serial-probe.
That directory is polled by a background process every two seconds. The
serial line is probed; if successful, the appropriate handler is created
and started via svc/demontools.

The Venusian considers this to be broken.

* Polling is bad. Don't do it.
* Many cheap adapters don't have serial numbers. You need to distinguish
  them somehow.
* Probing is time-consuming (multiple baud rates, protocols, device addresses
  on modbus, waiting for replies, starting multiple testers …).
* Probe messages can (and sometimes do) confuse the targets, esp. when sent
  at the "wrong" baud rate.
* There's no way to easily adjust the process, e.g. unconventional baud
  rates for Modbus/RTU.
* The probed device might be busy or booting up, thus not react in time.
* Devices that go away may or may not terminate the job started for them.

Our solution is different.

* New devices are handled by sending a message to a Unix socket.
  (Existing ones still use the symlink directory, for convenience.)
* The device handler reads a database of known devices, identified by serial
  number or bus position or whatnot. It then starts a systemd unit instance
  with the device (plus an opional parameter) as the instance name.
* Likewise, when a device goes away, its systemd unit is stopped.
* The program started by this, commonly a shell script, is responsible for
  executing whatever command the Victron probe system would have started.
* TODO: a helper to determine what the original serial prober would
  have done.


### Multi-site operation 

It is possible to run more than one Venus instance on the same host,
mostly thanks to systemd magic that bind-mounts the `/var/lib/venusian/NAME`
directory to `/data`.

Venus' MQTT topics are prefixed by the output of `get-unique-id`, which
returns the system's UUID. We modify this script to include the user ID.


## Installation

The `install` script copies a current Venus image to a subvolume or
subdirectory of the host system.

The script accepts a couple of arguments. `dir`, `root` and `mount` are
mandatory. You need to run it as root.

The Venus installation will be copied to the host system as-is. It won't
be modified.


### --image=/path/to/venus.img

The Venus image to use. Skip this option if you already unpacked or mounted
your Venus image.

The file may be gzip-compressed; in this case you'll need sufficient space
in /tmp for an uncompressed copy.

The special value "--image=-web-" downloads the current Venus version.
The image will be deleted after it's unpacked.


### --dest=/path/to/dir

The directory where you want to save (or did save) the Venus image to.
This option is mandatory unless you're creating a new Venusian user.

### --root=/path/to/debian

The Debian installation to install to. This may be the currently-running
system (use "/").

### --mount=/mnt/venus

The directory which `--dir` will be mounted to or accessible at.

This path is relative to `--root`.

If you skip this option *and* the root is `/`, the path from `--dir` will be used.
Otherwise you'll need to provide it.

### --quiet

Don't report print the script is doing (high-level).

### --verbose

Report shell commands as the installer executes them.

### --skip

Skip existing files. (By default, everything is overwritten.)

### --sub=WHAT

Also run the named add-on, stored in the directory `install.d/WHAT`.
This option may be used multiple times.

This allows you to customize the installation without modifying
the base script. See the "Customization" section, below, for details.

### --help

Prints a summary of the options given above, as well as a list of possible
add-ons.

## Examples

### Raspberry Pi SD Card

Let's assume you have an SD card for a Raspberry Pi 4 you'd like to Venusianize.

* Copy a [Debian image](https://raspi.debian.net/tested-images/) to the card
* Plug into your computer; ensure that the card is **not** auto-mounted
* Use parted or fdisk to add a new partition at the end (1 GByte is sufficient)
* grow the second partition ("RASPIROOT") to fill all available space
* `resize2fs /dev/sdX2` (whichever sdX device your card is)
* `mkfs.ext4 -L VENUS /dev/sdX3`
* mount the partitions; we'll assume you use `/mnt/part2` as the target
* `install -i /tmp/venus.img.gz -d /mnt/part2 -r /mnt/venus
* Add `LABEL=VENUS /mnt/venusian ext4 none 0 2` to `/mnt/part2/etc/fstab`
* unmount, eject, plug into Raspberry Pi, etc..

### A typical server

* `git clone https://github.com/M-o-a-T/venusian.git /opt/venusian`
* `cd /opt/venusian`
* `./install -i /tmp/venus.img.gz -d /opt/venus -r /
* systemctl start user@venus
* vncclient localhost:1


## helper scripts

All scripts are located in `/usr/lib/venusian/bin`. You can add this
directory to your path, or use shell aliases.

### get-unique-id

This is the script Venus uses to generate a unique ID, originally by using
the MAC address of `eth0`.

There are problems with this approach; some hosts don't have an `eth0`,
others might use a dynamic MAC for privacy. It's also not multi-user capable.

The Venusian uses a prefix of the machine ID and adds a the user ID (in hex).
You can add a "MACHID=XXX" line to `/etc/venusian/vars` or `/etc/venusian/NAME/vars`
if you want to override it. Note that the latter file includes the user ID.

### ven

`ven XXX` runs `XXX` as the user "venus". You can use "-u NAME" to switch to
a different user.

This helper is required because a mere `sudo -u venus` doesn't connect you to
the user's DBus.

### vctl

Alias to `ven systemctl --user`. The "-u NAME" option is accepted.

### vbus

Alias to `ven dbus`. The "-u NAME" option is accepted.

"dbus" is a script from Victron that's much nicer than the
standard dbus-send program.


## Environment settings


## File system structure

The Venusian does not change the Venus file system. It needs to fix a
few minor problems, but that's with by an overlay file system.

We do however need to add a few symlinks to the file system's root, and to /usr.


## Customization

You can add your own customization steps to a directory `install.d/NAME`.
It should contain bash scriptlets that are executed within the `install` script.

### Scriptlets 

These customizer scriptlets are used:

#### pre

Runs first.

#### post

Runs last.

#### pkg-r

Packages to install in the root.

Add them to the `$I` variable. Please try to test whether they're already there,
because if so we can skip the time-consuming `apt` step.

#### lib

If this script is supplied, it replaces the built-in method that creates a
hacked-up copy of the armhf ELF loader. You could use this to implement the
"patch Venus" strategy, as mentioned above.


### Variables

* R: the destination Debian system's root
* V: the Venus subdirectory (a copy of the whole Venus image)
* MNT: the mountpoint of $V on $R, typically /mnt/venus
* LIBV: /var/lib/venus (the Victron user's home directory)
* USRV: /usr/lib/venusian (common helper files and scripts)
* SUBS: array of scriptlets to run
* OVER: the overlay file system
* FORCE: unconditionally replace things

Remember that all of these may contain spaces or other special characters.
While we recommend to use paths without whitespace, it's still good practice
to quote **all** uses of these variables.


#### Overlay file system

The installer does not create a complete copy of `/opt/victronenergy` (the
directory Victron ships its code in). Instead, an overlay file system is
used. `$OVER` contains the path to the "upper directory" of the overlay
file system that we use to selectively alter files.

However, this might change, as userspace overlays impose a certain
runtime overhead.

Thus, a test whether to replace a file with a patched version should succeed if
any of

* `$FORCE` is set
* the destination doesn't exist
* source and destination files are identical
* the source is newer

It should always `rm -f` the destination and `mkdir -p` any intermediate
directories.

The helper function `fchg ‹source› ‹dest›` does this for you. It exits with
return code 1 if you don't need to do anything. Otherwise the destination
is a new empty file.

The helper `fln` creates a symlink at ‹dest› that points to ‹source›.

The overlay file system is mounted with an `opt-victronenergy.mount` systemd unit.


## Changes to the host system

This section broadly documents the install script's changes to the host filesystem.

* create and populate $V (350 MBytes; small image as of 2024-01)
* create a user and group "venusian"
* mount its overlay file system at `/opt/victronenergy`
* populate its home directory in $LIBV
* create a patched `/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3`
* create a directory `/v` (with library symlinks, for the loader)
* create a symlink `/data` (to $LIBV)
* populate $USRV
* add udev scripts
* add helpers with hardcoded paths:
  * get-unique-id (uses the host's machine ID)

## TODOs

Last but definitely not least, this is a work in progess.

### Support for more battery managers, meters, and whatnot

There are sure to be some more incompatibilities.
Bug reports, patches and additional code gladly accepted.


### Clean up the Venus copy

Much of the original Venus file system is no longer required and can be deleted
to free some space. For instance, there's 60 MBytes of kernel modules,
60 MBytes of Python 3.8, 40 MBytes of opkg data, 15 MBytes of web server content,
and almost all of `/bin` and `/usr/bin`.

Original image's root file system: 350 MB, 100 MB compressed; cleaned up: around
70 MBytes, uncompressed.

### Documentation

This file is way too long.

### Installation

When installing a specific version, find the corresponding image. This is
not trivial because on Victron's server the file name has a timestamp along
with the file name.
